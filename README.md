# FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN' + ALEX (le assets.)
This mod adds the good old Alex Jason. (sort of)

This repo is for source assets that were in the game (or not)

NOTES: 
- This github repository page is made for the new version, not the legacy version. If you want to look at some stuff that exists in the legacy version, check the old folder.

- This repo is also unfinished/W.I.P, especially the new content.
