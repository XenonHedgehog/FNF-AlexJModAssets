the old stuff folder. This is where you NEED to use Ibis Paint to open .ipv files. If not, well shame on you. No hidden legacy Alex stuff!

NOTES:

• Alex FNF Basic Anim.ipv (Nov 28, 2024 (new), Jun 21, 2024 (old)) - I'm gonna remove the hidden "thing" because it violates this mod for me.

• old alex icons + other icons.ipv - This is the first version of the Alex icons I've made (there is a winning icon for him). There are some icons that were for my planned mod or something. It is my intention to put in layer 1 and not layer 7.

• Untitled115.ipv - the old game over animation for Alex.

• Alex Icons.ipv - This is an updated version of the remaining Alex icons. There are extras too such as beta Alex icon (back then I made him blue) and a newer beta Alex icon.

There were more in the OLD folder's UNUSED folder
