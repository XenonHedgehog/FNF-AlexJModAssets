# THE UNUSED FOLDER

This is where stuff that doesn't brought into the mod. This is where all of my unused Ibis Paint stuff related to Alex in FNF.

INFO:

• Untitled77.ipv (Jun 17, 2024) - Tried to make an underground (from Vs. Whitty Definitive Edition) version of alex, but was scrapped

• Alex Scared test.ipv (Aug 10, 2024) - Alex Scared idle. That's it

• XMAS.ipv (May 20, 2024) - unused christmas variation of Alex mimicking Monster's santa hat frame-by-frame. This was unused because I'm very dumb at making ease. Interestingly, it had older versions of the poses.

• Weekend 1 alex cutscene.ipv - originally made in July? (August), this was supposed to have a cutscene for Alex in Weekend 1. Decided to add faces at November.

• 16-bit alex.ipv - this is where his current design originated from.

• 16 bit things and other.ipv - initial poses and miss poses for the pixel variant.

• alex jason pixel.ipv - made for animating the parts
