# THE UNUSED FOLDER

This is where stuff that doesn't brought into the mod. This is where all of my unused Ibis Paint stuff related to Alex in FNF.

• Untitled77.ipv - Tried to make an underground (from Vs. Whitty Definitive Edition) version of alex, but was scrapped

• Alex Scared test.ipv - Alex Scared idle. That's it

• XMAS.ipv - unused christmas variation of Alex mimicking Monster's santa hat frame-by-frame. This was unused because I'm very dumb at making ease. Interestingly, it uses the original version before I made an updated version of that

• Weekend 1 alex cutscene.ipv - originally made in July? (August), this was supposed to have a cutscene for Alex in Weekend 1 which predates the pico mix update. Decided to add faces at November.
